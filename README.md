# RainbowInspector

**TODO: Add description**

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `rainbow_inspector` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:rainbow_inspector, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```
After you've added Rainbow Inspector, you are ready to debug - with colors ;)
